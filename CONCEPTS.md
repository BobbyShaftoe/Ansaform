# CONCEPTS

## Implicitness of description

Something that we express the names and nature of a domain with 
- Understood
- Agreed
- Adopted
- Adhered
- Answers to questions about our domain
- We're stewards, sheriffs and custodians
- We like it tidy because we dont like cleaning up
- We don't like it when people are loose with it and mess it up
- We like rows
  a. and on each row an observation
  b. and for every relationship there's a column 

## Standards

### Schemas

Use meaningful property names that reflect the semantic type of the value

#### Common Formalised Attributes
1. An accepted standardisation of infrastructure resource within the Public Cloud domain
2. Something that is practiced, not just decided on
3. Confidence in the accuracy and consistency of meta data coming from any source within the Cloud technology value 
chain

4.  and Solid expectations for consistent 
reliability in 
reporting

#### Data Stewardship
Quite naturally it follows that having an accepted and disciplined practice, describing all 
resources within the infrastructure domain will achieve the desired state:

1. A tidy corpus of all reporting, meta information and documentation, and more importantly, little deviation 
in the schema that describes the domain overall
2. A distributed schema that depends with no dependency on any database service or related network transport; viz. 
any report produced from meta files is a localised graph that has no edge dependencies at the border nodes 






### Complete Project Reference
_"When it comes to releasing software @hashicorp ranks high on the list of maintainers that do it right.
Versioned archives with docs, source, build scripts, and the website._" 

_"OS specific executables; even NetBSD is shown love._" 

_"They also provide Docker images if that's your thing._"
